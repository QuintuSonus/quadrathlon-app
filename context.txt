Quadrathlon Gaming Night App - Project Context Summary
Overview
The Quadrathlon Gaming Night app is a web application built for four friends (David, Manu, Antoine, and Quentin) to manage their competitive gaming sessions. The app facilitates player selection, scoring, and rankings across multiple games while hiding the running score until a final reveal.
Core Features

Cooperative: Players form two 2v2 teams
1v1 Tournament: Bracket-style tournament with semifinals, final, and 3rd place match
2v2: Two teams compete against each other


Randomization

Random player selection for individual games
Random team generation for team-based games
Random tournament bracket generation


Scoring Methods
